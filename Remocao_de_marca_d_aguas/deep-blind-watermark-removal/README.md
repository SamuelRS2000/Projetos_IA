<i>The overview of the proposed two-stage framework. Firstly, we propose a multi-task network, SplitNet, for watermark detection, removal,  and recovery. Then, we propose the RefineNet to smooth the learned region with the predicted mask and the recovered background from the previous stage. As a consequence, our network can be trained in an end-to-end fashion without any manual intervention. Note that, for clarity, we do not show any skip-connections between all the encoders and decoders.</i>

### Datasets

We synthesized four different datasets for training and testing, you can download the dataset via [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vinthony/watermark-removal-logo/tree/main).

> Other Pre-trained Models are still reorganizing and uploading, it will be released soon.


### Demos

An easy-to-use online demo can be founded in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pYY7byBjM-7aFIWk8HcF9nK_s6pqGwww?usp=sharing).

The local demo will be released soon.

### Pre-requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train

Besides training our methods, here, we also give an example of how to train the [s2am](https://github.com/vinthony/s2am) under our framework. More details can be found in the shell scripts.


```
bash examples/evaluation.sh
```

### Test

```
bash examples/test.sh
```
